A simple javascript game where player dodge bombs falling from the sky.

**How Game Works**
1. Player has two lives in total. Each life is lost upon unsuccessul dodge i.e. collision with bomb.
2. Place where bomb falls is totally random.
3. Score is counted until player is dead.
4. Speed of falling bombs increases as score goes up.
5. When all lives are lost game is over and user/player can play again.
